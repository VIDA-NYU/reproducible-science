<p>Lecture on January 25, 2016; 4:00pm to 5:00pm; 3110 Etcheverry Hall at Berkely Institute of Data Science. What does it mean to work reproducibly and transparently? Why bother? Whom does it benefit, and how? What will it cost me? What work habits will I need to change? Will I need to learn new tools? What resources help? What's the simplest thing I can do to make my work more reproducible? How can I move my discipline, my institution, and science as a whole towards reproducibility?</p>
