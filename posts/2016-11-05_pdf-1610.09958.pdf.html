<p>We present an overview of the recently funded "Merging Science and Cyberinfrastructure Pathways: The Whole Tale" project (NSF award #1541450). Our approach has two nested goals: 1) deliver an environment that enables researchers to create a  complete  narrative  of  the  research process including exposure of the data-to-publication lifecycle, and 2)  systematically and persistently link research publications to their associated digital scholarly objects such as the data,  code, and workflows. To enable this, WholeTale will create an environment where researchers can collaborate on data,  workspaces, and workflows and then publish them for future adoption or modification. Published data and applications will  be consumed either directly by users using the Whole Tale environment or can be integrated into existing or future  domain  Science Gateways.</p>
