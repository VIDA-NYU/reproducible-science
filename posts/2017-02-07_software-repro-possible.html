<p>This blog is based on part of a talk I gave in January 2017, and the thinking behind it, in turn, is based on my view of a series of recent talks and blogs, and how they might be fit  together. The short summary is that general software reproducibly is hard at best, and may not be practical except in special cases.</p>
