<p>ReproZip was featured in a post on the Library of Congress's digital preservation blog, the Signal. The author, Genevieve Havemeyer-King, writes "ReproZip is a tool being developed at NYU "aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible experiments from command-line executions", and could be something to consider as an alternative to many costly web-archiving services for preservation of internet-based projects and applications."</p>
