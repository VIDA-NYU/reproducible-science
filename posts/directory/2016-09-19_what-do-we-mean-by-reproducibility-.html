<p>Thereâ€™s been a lot of discussion across many scientific fields about the "reproducibility crisis" in the past few years. Hundreds of psychologists attempted to redo 100 studies as part of the Reproducibility Project in Psychology, and claimed that fewer than half of the replication attempts succeeded. In Biomedicine, a study from the biotech firm Amgen tried to re-create results of 53 "landmark" preclinical cancer studies, and only got the same results for six of them. Amid a growing concern about research reliability, funders including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have called for a greater effort to make research reproducible through transparent reporting of the methods researchers use to conduct their investigations.</p>
