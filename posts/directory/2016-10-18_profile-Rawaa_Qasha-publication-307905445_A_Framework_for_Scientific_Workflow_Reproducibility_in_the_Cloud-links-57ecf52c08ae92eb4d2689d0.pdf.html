<p>Workflow is a well-established means by which to capture scientific methods in an abstract graph of interrelated processing tasks. The reproducibility of scientific workflows is therefore fundamental to reproducible e-Science. However, the ability to record all the required details so as to make a workflow fully reproducible is a long-standing problem that is very difficult to solve. In this paper, we introduce an approach that integrates system description, source control, container management and automatic deployment techniques to facilitate workflow reproducibility. We have developed a framework that leverages this integration to support workflow execution, re-execution and reproducibility in the cloud and in a personal computing environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by ex-amining various aspects of repeatability and reproducibility on real scientific workflows. The framework allows workflow andtask images to be captured automatically, which improves not only repeatability but also runtime performance. It also gives workflows portability across different cloud environments. Finally, the framework can also track changes in the development of tasks and workflows to protect them from unintentional failures.</p>
