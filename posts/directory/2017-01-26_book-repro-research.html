<p>This symposium will serve as the launch event for our new open, online book, titled The Practice of Reproducible Research. The book contains a collection of 31 case studies in reproducible research practices written by scientists and engineers working in the data-intensive sciences. Each case study presents the specific approach that the author used to achieve reproducibility in a real-world research project, including a discussion of the overall project workflow, major challenges, and key tools and practices used to increase the reproducibility of the research.</p>
